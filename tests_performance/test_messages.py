Proposed Performance Tests
1. How much time would it take for message to arrive with a certain number of hops (1000 or 10.000 or 100.000)?
a. We can create a benchmark table to see a few timings and then decide on the number of hops we need to 'watch' for.
b. A discussion with business owner or clients would be usefull here, to determine whats important in terms of performance.
How are the clients actually plan to use the system? What are the business cases of the system?
c. What infrastructure/environment would we need setup for performance tests? With 5 nodes we can hardly have a close environment
to the production one. So, we have to define the test environment for performance testing.
2.
